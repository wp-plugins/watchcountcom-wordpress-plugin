The WatchCount.com WP Plugin is a free eBay WP plugin that shows Most Popular (or a seller's) eBay items in a blog's sidebar or posts.

== Description ==

The WatchCount.com WordPress Plugin (WCCWPPI) is a **free** eBay WordPress plugin that displays Most Popular eBay items and auctions in real-time -- in your blog's sidebar (a *WordPress Widget*) and/or within individual blog posts. You can also display eBay items from any specific **seller**, or show the **eBay Daily Deals**.

Most Popular eBay items displayed have been voted on by both shoppers and sellers and ranked accordingly: compared to the millions of eBay listings active at any given moment, our plugin features ones that reflect an actual, **cumulative interest** by registered eBay users! Your blog's visitors can click through to these compelling items listed live on eBay.

You can select keyword phrases and eBay categories as the basis of the displayed items. Even better, you can specify your keywords globally (for your entire blog), directly **within your posts** as you type them (via *anchor tags* such as `[eBay "Fender Mustang"]`), **automatically** via the post tags that WordPress already requests of you in each post –- or allow your readers to enter their own terms in the embedded search box.

This plugin is created and powered by [WatchCount.com](http://www.WatchCount.com/ "WatchCount.com - Most Watched eBay Items/Auctions"), an [eBay Compatible Application](http://www.WatchCount.com/go/?link=wp_i_cac "WatchCount.com is an eBay Compatible Application.") and recipient of a [2009 eBay Star Developer Award](http://www.WatchCount.com/go/?link=wp_i_award "WatchCount.com was a recipient of a 2009 eBay Star Developer Award.").

= Who might want to use the WCCWPPI? =

Niche bloggers may like to showcase interesting products to their readership –- items that actual eBay users have voted as most popular -– knowing that eBay, with its extensive and varied marketplace, is an easy place to locate appealing items in almost any category (iPods, real estate, collectible coins, giant bubble wrap...). By specifying just a few keywords or **post tags**, continuously updated, in-demand items can be displayed to your audience.

**eBay sellers** who blog might also enjoy the ability to showcase their products, whether tacitly in their blog's sidebar, or more overtly -- embedded within posts. The WCCWPPI can also display any specific eBay item, good for directing readers' attention to a newly listed product. Moreover, if you're a fan of the famed [eBay Daily Deals](http://www.WatchCount.com/go/?link=wp_i_edd "eBay Daily Deals"), you can opt to display those as well.

If you have an **ePN** account and a blog on your own domain, you can potentially make money by generating affiliate commissions when your visitors click through to eBay then make purchases.
